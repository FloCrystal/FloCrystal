## Hi there 👋

Hello, I’m Ning Jiang (江宁). I am currently a master's student majoring in Control Science and Engineering at **Northeast Forestry University**(https://www.nefu.edu.cn/). 

My research interests include multimodal medical imaging, continual learning and autonomous driving vision perception technology. I am still in the initial learning stage of my scientific research and have strong self-motivation. 

Currently, my total number of citations on Google Scholar is over 100. <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XfKD8e8AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FFloCrystal%2Fflocrystal.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations">
